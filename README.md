### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a curious coder from NYC. Check out some of my work [here](https://mikmaks97.github.io).

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an exciting sustainability project with my friend [@brooyt](https://github.com/brooyt).

ðŸ“š Iâ€™m currently learning all about networks. You'll find network-related work in my blog and repositories and more is on the way.
